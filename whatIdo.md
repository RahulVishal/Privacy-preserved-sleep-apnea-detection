This implementation demonstrates the training approach through a simple server-client model. The server is written in NodeJS and uses the web-push protocol for communication. The web-push service works by maintaining endpoints URLs for all clients. These endpoint URLs are generated after client consent and stored on the server. When training begins, the server notes the list of clients. This is to ensure that within each the training period, we don't deal with the added complexity of changing trainees. Once the list of clients who will train - "trainers" - is fixed, the server pings the first of the clients through web-push. The client (or trainer) gets the current semi-trained model through the push payload and trains that on local data. This training is well established through ML libraries for JS - tfjs/scikitjs. After training is complete, the trainer will use a POST request to send the data back to the server. Upon receiving a quasi-trained model, the server will forward it to the trainer on list. This process repeats until the list is exhausted. This marks the completion of one epoch. The model is then saved. This process is designed to be repeatable. The second epoch will use the result of the first as the seed model.
